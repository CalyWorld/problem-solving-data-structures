# Graphs

Objectives

- Explain what a graph is
- Compare and Contrast different types of graphs and their use cases in the real world
- Implement a graph using an adjacency list
- Traverse through a graph using BFS and DFS

Graph in my own understanding is interconnection of nodes, there is no parent or children like in Trees, Connections can go to any node and there is no starting nodes.

Uses of Graphs

- Social Networks
- Location / Mapping
- Routing ALgorithms
- Visual Hierarchy
- FIle System Optimizations
- **EVERYWHERE**

Essential Graph Terms

- Vertex - a node
- Edge - connection between nodes
- weighted/unweighted - values assigned to distances between vertices
  - unweighted graphs are graphs with no values of connections
  - weighted graphs are graphs with values of connections
- directed/undirected - directions assigned to distanced between vertices
  - directed has pointed arrows to vertices
  - undirected has no pointed arrows to vertices
